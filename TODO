 - CRYPTO


= PARSILLADE =
Ticket #13: Write parse_t_as_value functions
 - the objective is to do parse and value_of in one pass
 - and to keep the context (offset/len)

Ticket #14: Generate modules around top-level PTypes
 - the interface should be (type t / parse / dump / value_of / parse_value_of)
 - it should allow to produce a short description

Ticket #15: Create a registry of top-level PTypes
 * Depends on #14
 - the modules generated should automatically be added to the registry
 - write a PoC, called parsifal, to parse every possible top-level PType and print its value
   * the PType selection could be given by a command line option
   * or by trying every possible stuff?

Ticket #16: parsillade
 * Depends on #13, #14 and #15
 - write a GUI to explore files


= CRYPTO =
 - extract crypto-related files in crypto/ dir
 - clean up RSA/PKCS#1 implementation (ticket #1)
 - include X509 support in crypto/
 - clean up PKCS#7 implementation using recursive PTypes
 - Ticket #46: Write a sym_cipher_algo module interface
 - Ticket #45: Write a asym_cipher_algo module interface



Ticket #1: Implement properly RSA/PKCS#1
 - merge pkcs1.ml and rSAKey.ml in rsa.ml
 - create a crypto directory?
 - write a proper pkcs1_container
 - write test_pkcs1.ml to check RSA implementation (unit tests)
 - write some perf test to see whether cryptokit is needed => should be added to prepare-release.sh
 - optionaly, try to simplify the RSA code to avoid the useless creation of a key object (however, this might need getting rid of cryptokit and take some performance hit)

Ticket #2: Sort and document pTypes and pContainers
 - merge basePTypes/PTypes/ASN1Ptypes?
 - ocamldoc all them


Add fields to describe features/bugs => core/crypto/net/format/tools


Ticket #3: Write some PNG tools
 - look at the pngcrush project
 - write a PNG normalizer
 - write PNG to BPM converter

Ticket #4: Tag every file/dir with some short doc
 - write READMEs and stuff to quickly describe what's what
 - create a proper Changelog

Ticket #5: Clean up source code from all those TODOs
 - write tickets from all the TODOs in ml files

Ticket #6: Tune getopt
 - improve help usage messages: one-liner and optional details, multiline descriptions
 - handle constraints on the number of args
 - document arg handling (for example, when it is a command)
 - help factoring some code (verbose option, file handling, action handling)

Ticket #7: Implement more DNS RR types
 - AAAA, SRV, TKEY, TSIG, AXFR, IXFR, OPT
 - SPF
 - CAA, CERT, SSHFP, TLSA
 - DLV DS, DNSKEY, RRSIG, NSEC, NSEC3, NSEC3PARAM

Ticket #8: Rewrite TLS context
 * NEEDS A LOT OF WORK
 - merge tls_context and ssl2_context?
 - rethink tlsEngine / tls to incorporate context checks/updates in the description?
 - work on TlsEngine.update* functions
 - merge TlsEngine and TlsUtil?
 - write the automata (client, server, transparent proxy, normalizing proxy)
 - add a automaton_state field in context
 - add a check_consistency field in context
 - add a generic update function relying on the context and the message received to
   * check the consistency if necessary
   * update the state
   * return what to do next?
 - add another generic function with hooks for after each message / alert / appdata / ccs / heartbeat

Ticket #9: Clean up CRC implementation
 - this should go in core/crc.ml or util/crc.ml
 - write all the CRC needed for PNG and GZip (CRC16 and 32)
 - write crc_containers

Ticket #10: Improve Makefile and the compilation process
 - cleanup the Makefile to handle the .mli -> .cmi generation properly
   * force the ml -> mli generation when mli does not exist ?
   * explicit the mli -> cmi transformation
 - handle inter-lib dependencies in the overall Makefile
 - cleanup the directory madness (LIBDIR/BINDIR) and use standard stuff instead

Ticket #11: Sort and document all the modules
 * Depends on #10
 - rethink the overall organisation in directories
 - syntax and core should be merged?
 - add .mli for all files!
 - ocamldoc everything

Ticket #12: Improve asn1_struct
 - for now, options are used for the struct and the asn1_alias
 - it is not the logical way to handle top (which should only affect the asn1_alias)
 - furthermore, params option should be added in definition and in the aliased type

Ticket #17: Recursive PType definitions
 * NEEDS A LOT OF WORK
 - add recursive type definitions between "begin_parsifal_block" and "end_parsifal_block"
 - in fact, the idea would be to populate the following structure when preprocessing a PType
   * type definition
   * type dependencies (to try to sort the PTypes inside a block)
   * parse/parse_as_value
   * dump
   * (optional) int_of / of_int / of_string
   * (optional) string_of
   * value_of
 - some functions could be overloaded by the developer
 - if a string_of is defined inside such a block, use it in value_of (and always create a VRecord)
 - for example, it would be simpler to write string_of_mx_rdata/soa_rdata and not all the value_of
 - it could also allow to skip automatically parse/dump/value_of generation when they are given by the developer

Ticket #18: Clean up PKCS#7 implementation
 * NEEDS A LOT OF WORK
 * Depends on #17
 - find a way to put the implementation (it should not be in kerby, but rather in crypto?)
 - allow for recursive definition?

Ticket #19: Look at DEX format
 * NEEDS A LOT OF WORK
 * Depends on #17

Ticket #20: Rewrite Base64 implementation

Ticket #21: Write PCAP helpers
 - the idea would be to automatically handle getopt base options, file processing and TCP/UDP connexion extraction
 - this would be appreciated for extractSessions and kerby
 - Resolution: it has been done another way in pcapContainers and parsifal_main
 - improve tcp/udp containers?

Ticket #22: Be more cautious about int32 types...
 * THIS IS A BUG!
 * NEEDS A LOT OF WORK
 - clean up integer handling in uint types
 - insure it works properly on x86 and x86-64

Ticket #23: Cleanup all ZLib containers
 - using CRCs and various checks

Ticket #24: Rethink the union options
 * NEEDS A LOT OF WORK
 - this is about union and asn1_union
 - the params are
   * Enrich status : always-enrich, enrich_by_default, dont_enrich_by_default (the last two add an enrich bool ref)
   * Exhaustive status : true or false
   * Fail status when enriching has failed : exception, unparsed_constructor => rewrite it without the safe_union container
   * In fact, naming the UnknownVal constructor is not necessary => UnknownVal of type / Exception
 - the possibilities should be:
   * "closed" => always-enrich, exception on "_" case
   * "closed" + "exhaustive" => do not add the "_" case
   * (default) => dont_enrich_by_default, exhaustive = false, on fail => let the exception go
   * options "enrich", "exhaustive", "soft_fail" to change the default
   * option "unparsed_type" to specify the type and remove the mandatory name?
 - add SoftExceptions for enums (could be useful for content_type / alert_level)
 - add a "flexible" decorator in structures
   -> try to parse or if it fails, parse with ~enrich:false (it would only be effective on union, but it still counts)
   -> add another one to have "flexible-like field : type" turned into "field : | Either type | Or binstring" ?
   -> Apply it to MP_REACH_NLRI in Mrt.
   -> Apply it to ATV/Extensions/Times (flexible option + laxist option in input)... because that is where the parsing fails (and it should by default!)
 - add a new VParsingError type and a choice decorator [parsingError] to remember when a safe_union failed

Ticket #25: Think about a real get language
 * NEEDS A LOT OF WORK
 - improve get_wrapper (raw, gzip, base64, etc.)
 - add {,} to get path language (x.{y,z}.{t,a})
 - design a real language to explore values (functions like hex / dump / substring / asn1parse / M.parse one day and conditionnal expressions...)

Ticket #26: Think about t_of_value generation
 * NEEDS A LOT OF WORK

Ticket #27: Think about a put function
 * NEEDS A LOT OF WORK
 - more precisely, a way to browse a value and modify it while browsing
 - this idea of cursor can be found in some Haskell books (ref?)

Ticket #28: Improve mapAnswers
 - add record_version to A/H answer types
 - add support for client_hello_sent in mapAnswers/answer_type?
 - add SSLv2 support in mapAnswers (especially -g)

Ticket #29: First support for the PDF format
 * NEEDS A LOT OF WORK

Ticket #30: First support for the HTTP protocol
 * NEEDS A LOT OF WORK

Ticket #31: Code some context helpers
 - the context could be a (string, 'a) Hashtbl.t
 - we should write some useful functions to allow for a simple parsing context and standardized parse_checkpoints/parse_fields

Ticket #32: Clean up DNS implementation
 - write tests for DNS
 - add an optional parameter "dont_quote" to print_value
 - use "dont_quote" in picodig
 - picodig (using a special sr function (send/receive)?)

Ticket #36: Improve bitfield support
 - rewrite dns_flags using flags in dnsXX.ml in tutorial.
 - at the end of structs, at the end of exact_parse, check None
 - use parsifal.mli to control cur_bitstate tightly
 - add more checks to check bitstate = None when working on bytes?
 - check the performance on simple unit tests?
 - improve support for RightToLeft bit parsing
   * add more efficient versions to parse zLib-style bit fields
   * write dump_rtol_bit(s) functions

Ticket #37: Improve lwt support for fallback strategies
 - maybe lwt_parse_byte/lwt_parse_string/... should store the bytes read in a Buffer

Ticket #38: Implement support for CSR (PKCS#10?)

Ticket #39: Implement support for OCSP

Ticket #40: Implement support for CRLs

Ticket #41: Cross-reference the RFCs / PKCS standards implemented

Ticket #43: Write a cool support for DSA

Ticket #44: Implement a signature_algo module interface
 - verify/sign
 - write a signed_block container using the module

Ticket #45: Write a asym_cipher_algo module interface
 - encrypt/decrypt
 - write a asym_encrypted_block

Ticket #46: Write a sym_cipher_algo module interface
 - encrypt/decrypt
 - write a asym_encrypted_block
 - Look at the code of cryptokit which seems groovy

Ticket #47: Infer automatically the dump_arg fields.
 - dump_arg is a new simple prefix to allow for structure fields to be visible from dump functions:
 - "dump_arg field;" adds a "let field = struct.field in" in the dump function.
 - it might be useful to infer the dump_args from the PTypes args (the free variables named as a field?)




v0.3 (may 2013)
 - Software Engineering
   * Write some tests (unit tests, non-regression [for X.509 for example], coverage test, etc.)
   * non-regression test on answer-type/ncerts
 - TlsEngine (work needed to factor code in mapAnswers and extractSessions properly)
   * Move mapAnswers.split_record in TlsUtil?
   * [?] add a function "process_in : tls_record Lwt_mvar t -> tls_context -> tls_record Lwt_mvar t" which tries and aggregates messages, enrich handshakes and put one by record. When compression/cryptography works, it will also take that into account.
   * [?] add a function "process_out" to compress/mac/encrypt and slice in records of the correct length.
   * put 'a result_type and handle_answer logic from probe_server into TlsEngine
 - Write a trivial RC4-MD5 SSL client or server
 - Factor some code (lwt_parse_file filename lwt_parse_fun; the more common options (enrich, verbose, input handling); get machinery)
 - X509
   * Code construct_chains/check_chains in caml
     + add decoration directly to the certificate object (origin[s], trust)?
     + x509_chain should be an object module
       - list of decorated certs (trust, origin [Mozilla store, cert n in chain])
       - global attributes (enriched by check/chains with args [laxist, trusted store])
     + Low level functions
       - prepare_candidates (H : DN hashes -> certs)
       - find_next_candidate (H, current, options [use KI?])
       - check_link (subject, issuer)
     + Chain construction (chain up until now + pool of available certs [chain + trusted certs + untrusted certs])
       - avoid loops!
     + Chain checks (which can take trusted certificate stores to decorate the chain object)
       - validity span
       - check subject/issuer (+ *UniqueIdentifiers?)
       - signature
       - is there a trusted cert in the chain constructed
       - algos used
       - SKI/AKI could be relaxed (Applications are not required to verify that key identifiers match when performing certification path validation)
       - BC/
       - functions to check usage/name of the chain
       - use SAN/AIA/CRLDP/KU/EKU/NameConstraints or shout if a critical extension is not yet parsed
     + TLS chain construction -> use construct_chain with different stores (untrusted, MS, FF)
     + TLS chain analysis -> nCerts, nDupes, nUnused, nChains [+ characterisation]
     + Graph construction (From a big pool of certs, try to create all the links...)
   * Add a way to create a certificate object
 - Tools
   * Write a cool passive TLS_Proxy
   * check_sslserver (see check_sslserver.ml for a complete TODO)
   * rewrite server-answer with the following options
     + implement control over record splitting
   * improve probe-server
     + add SSLv2 support
     + add a way to handle TLS extensions
   * bgpdump and/or obsdump
   * x509check (enrich the x509 object before analysing!)
   * chaincheck
   * Create simple PKI tools to create a RSA key, sign, verify, encrypt, decrypt, handle a simple PKI (rsa tool)
   * Write acu (AceSL Cert Util) to read certs / pubkeys / privkeys and manipulate them

 - General
   * Think about the exception system (fatal or not) => merge all in ParsifalException
 - Tls
   * use record check functions to constrain a binrec (length of 2^14 in TlsRecord)
   * Implement every extension/PK present in ssl-data
 - Tools
   * x509compare
   * Begin a GUI for PKI tools
   * crlshow / crlcompare
   * a tool to re-sign a modified certificate (given you have the adequate private key of course)
   * Add a general config directory, modifiable by cmdline, by general config file and by local config file (which could contain a directory of OIds)
   * s_client
   * Active TLS_Proxy
   * dgst : options (-quiet, -hex, -check, -file + args / ou stdin)
   * Gestion du temps passé (man 2 times) et ajout de barres de progression

   * certificates with extensions containing images
   * certificates signing each other (A <-> B)
 - PKCS#11 client (prospective)


v0.4 (jun. 2013)
 - Think about a smart_dump function, which would auto-fill missing values (sizes, crcs...) => it could also be implemented using t_of_value and default/auto-fill information
 - Maybe add a lwt_dump_* function?
 - Propose a lwt_parse_wrapper, which stupidly tries to read byte by byte and give the result to parse? It could be improved when an input is rewindable or if OutOfBounds gave the number of bytes needed to continue (at least when some info is available)
 - X509
   * Add a test to really check if the idempotence was broken!
 - Tools
   * s_server
 - PKCS#11 ressource (prospective)


v1.0 (oct 2013)
 - Rewrite the type names/field names to be uniform (we must choose between camel case and underscores)
 - Cross-reference where each RFC is implemented (annotate the RFC and the code)
 - Software Engineering
   * Document everything (ocamldoc or doxygen)
   * unit tests for everything
 - Tools which should be usable
   * asn1parse
   * x509
   * rsa
   * pki
   * tlsparse
